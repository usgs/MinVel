# MinVel
This program is used to calculate anharmonic p- and s-wave velocity and density for zero-porosity mineral aggregates. It is based on the work of Hacker and Abers (2004, updated in 2016) with additional minerals and optimized for related work. Running the code requires a mineral physics database, MineralPhysicsDatabase_181107.mat. Combined with a petrologic database (Sowers and Boyd, in press) and thermal and geologic models, results from this code are used in the program RockProp.m, which accounts for rock porosity and seismic attenuation. These codes are part of an effort to produce a three dimensional national crustal model for use with seismic hazard studies. (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5b046c6ce4b0d8682b96353a).

Please see or query the code for help (e.g. Matlab>> help MinVel).

Any questions regarding the code can be directed to olboyd@usgs.gov.
